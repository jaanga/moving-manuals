***

>> I would like it packaged in an animated power point or video that explains / illustrates:

How about a web page with the apps embedded?


## The Manuals

The manuals are now apps - or at least working app prototypes. 
And just like any app in the App store, the fastest easiest way to see if you like an app is to try it out yourself.


>> b. Explaining the process / scope of doing this on the full IKEA catalogue.

## Communicate the existence of the moving manuals to customers.

A simple, fast easy way to inform people of the Moving Manuals is to place a link under the links to the PDF files in the online catalog

In the paper catalog, there could be a QR code or a short link

Add links to Catalog page and Mobile catalog page, QR code and short links,



### Design and Quality Standards

https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/313392/design_quality_standards.pdf

The ease of understanding, the consistency between products, the elegance of the graphics has to match that of the exiting paper/PDF manuals.

This will entail establishing a good working relationship with Ikea TechPubs

d. A proposal on how we can work with IKEA to roll this out.

## Designs and Code Hosted on GitHub 

All Moving Manuals design ad code are created, edited and hosted on [GitHub]( http://github/com ).

GitHub is the largest code host on the planet with over 31 million repositories. 
Large or small, every repository comes with the same powerful tools. 
These tools are open to the community for public projects and secure for private projects.

### Git Revision Control

* Frictionless Context Switching.
	* Create a branch to try out an idea, commit a few times, switch back to where you branched from, apply a patch, switch back to where you are experimenting, and merge it in.
* Role-Based Codelines. 
	* Have a branch that always contains only what goes to production, another that you merge work into for testing, and several smaller ones for day to day work.
* Feature Based Workflow. 
	*Create new branches for each new feature you're working on so you can seamlessly switch back and forth between them, then delete each branch when that feature gets merged into your main line.
* Disposable Experimentation. 
	* Create a branch to experiment in, realize it's not going to work, and just delete it - abandoning the work—with nobody else ever seeing it (even if you've pushed other branches in the meantime).

[About Git]( https://git-scm.com/about )

### Management


### Collaborative Design Reviews
Design and code reviews are an essential part of the Moving Manuals workflow. 
GitHub allows you and your teammates to have a detailed discussion about every commit that is pushed to your project. 
Should it be included? Was it done correctly? Should something else be added? 
Talk about changes to your code with everyone involved before releasing or incorporating them.

You can have conversations on entire commits as well as individual lines of code.
Forking and merging designs
Notification emails
Graphs and contributions

Integrations with Trello, Slack, Freshdesk and many other apps and services that help you chat, track your progress, and work better with your team.

### Issue Management and feedback / Integrated issue tracking
* Project issues page can be as simple or as sophisticated as you like.
* Set a due date, name your milestone, then start grouping issues together.
* Filter by open and closed issues, assignees, labels, and milestones. 
* Sort by issue age, number of comments, and update time.

### Serious security
* Team and Individual permission levels
* Enabling and restricting access for third parties
* Audit logs, two factor authentication
* SSL, HTTPS, and SSH data transmission and two-factor authentication are core elements of security at GitHub.

[GitHub Security]( https://help.github.com/articles/github-security/ )

### Access to Content Delivery Networks( CDN )

* Instant Purge and Provisioning
	* Make your new origin deployments seen immediately.
* Realtime Reporting
	* reporting and analytics engine gives meaning to your data so you can make informed decisions.
* You can access your logs realtime through our API, our log viewer in the Control Panel or via MaxCLI—our command line interface.
* Our realtime reporting system allows you to view, calculate and predict future behavior.

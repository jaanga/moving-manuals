## _disrupting the process of assembling things_

Common patterns or issues that occur when you put things together

* You put something together, find a mistake then have to start all over
* You look at a picture a hundred times and still do not understand
* You put something together and want to share the pleasure with others

Moving Manuals is about making the process of putting things together easier, faster and more fun.

The apps from Moving Manuals are:

* Always available: Interactive apps that work on your phone, tablet or computer
* Easy to follow: Designed to show the entire process in 3D 
* A pleasure to work with: The cinematography, musical score and sets are produced for enjoyment

Now please scroll down and play with our demos. 
All of the following demos are based on popular items from the wonderful Ikea web site. 
Please note that we have no connection with Ikea.
You may also see further examples this effort for [WikiHouse]( http://wikihouse.github.io/viewer-experiments/ ) and [OpenDesk]( http://opendesk.github.io/design-playground/ ).

You may run the four apps here or - even better - click the title under the app to run it full scree.

Each of the apps supports the following:

* Rotate = one finger / left mouse
* Zoom = two fingers / scroll wheel << full screen only
* Pan = three fingers / right mouse
* Reset = click the on the title 

### Things you can do

* Create a bookshelf with seven columns width and six rows high
* Create a bookshelf with exactly just one cubbyhole
* Have a look at any of the several materials

# full screen demo: [Wall Bracket zoom-in]( kallax-wall-bracket/index.html )
An assembly detail. Rendered with raw colors. Four shory videos rather than a long single video.

### Things you can do

* Use for fingers or mouse to look from under the shelf
* Switch back abd forth between whole shelf assemble and detail assembly

### Things you can do

* Click on individual items to see them come and go from floor to final position

An assembly detail - rendered in 'raw' colors.

### Things you can do

* Pause the assembly video by clicking the checkbox

>> I would like it packaged in an animated power point or video that explains / illustrates:

>> b. Explaining the process / scope of doing this on the full IKEA catalogue.
>> d. A proposal on how we can work with IKEA to roll this out.

How about a web page with the apps embedded? Like what you are seeing now?

# Process and Scope

## The Manuals

The manuals are now apps - or at least working app prototypes. 
And just like any app in the App store, the fastest easiest way to see if you like an app is to try it out yourself.


## Communicate existence of Moving Manuals to customers

A simple, fast easy way to inform people of the Moving Manuals is to place a link under the links to the PDF files in an online catalog

In the paper catalog, there could be a QR code or a short link

Add links to Catalog page and Mobile catalog page, QR code and short links,

![Catalog page]( ./kallax-nxn/kallax-catalog-page.jpg =800x800 )

<p> </p>

And on mobile, note extra link at bottom of page:


![Catalog page]( ./kallax-nxn/kallax-catalog-page-mobile.jpg =300x500 )

Adding links to existing web pages is easy



## Design and Quality Standards

We seek work with organizations that set high standards for quality and even for improving the quality of the standards.

The ease of understanding, the consistency between products, the elegance of the graphics has to match that of the exiting paper/PDF manuals.

This will entail establishing a good working relationship with Ikea TechPubs

## Knowledge / Intellectual Property

We can teach and build tutorials so client designers how to make their own moving manuals

In preparing manuals, we import 3D data directly from CD programs. 
And/or we can export our data in STL, DXF, JSON and other formats.

Ownership of intellectual property remains with Moving Manuals authors unless otherwise agreed.

## Designs and Code Hosted on GitHub 

All Moving Manuals design ad code are created, edited and hosted on [GitHub]( http://github/com ).

GitHub is the largest code host on the planet with over 31 million repositories. 
Large or small, every repository comes with the same powerful tools. 
These tools are open to the community for public projects and secure for private projects.
There are many features and benefits to the use of GitHub as a digital repository for 3D designs.
These are features simply not available via the traditional design firm and normal designer/client collaboration.

The following sections cover the advantages of being on GitHub - and enabling small teams and bif teams to collaborate without skipping a beat 


### Management

### Git Revision Control

* Frictionless Context Switching.
	* Create a branch to try out an idea, commit a few times, switch back to where you branched from, apply a patch, switch back to where you are experimenting, and merge it in.
* Role-Based Design Streams. 
	* Have a design branch that always contains only what goes to production, another that you merge work into for testing, and several smaller ones for day to day work.
* Feature Based Workflow. 
	* Create new design branches for each new feature you're working on so you can seamlessly switch back and forth between them, then delete each branch when that feature gets merged into your main line.
* Disposable Experimentation. 
	* Create a branch to experiment in, realize it's not going to work, and just delete it - abandoning the work—with nobody else ever seeing it (even if you've pushed other branches in the meantime).

### Collaborative Design Reviews

* Design and code reviews are an essential part of the Moving Manuals workflow
* GitHub allows you and your teammates to have a detailed discussion about every commit that is pushed to your project
	* Should it be included? Was it done correctly? Should something else be added? 
	* Talk about changes to your designs with everyone involved before releasing or incorporating them.
* You can have conversations on entire commits as well as individual lines of code.
* Forking and merging designs
* Notification emails
* Graphs and contributions

Integrations with Trello, Slack, Freshdesk and many other apps and services that help you chat, track your progress, and work better with your team.

Link: [GitHub Integrations]( https://github.com/integrations )

### Issue Management and feedback / Integrated issue tracking

* Project issues page can be as simple or as sophisticated as you like
* Set a due date, name your milestone, then start grouping issues together
* Filter by open and closed issues, assignees, labels, and milestones
* Sort by issue age, number of comments, and update time


### Serious Security

Using GitHun allows a small firm to piggyback on the expertise one one ofe the mst secure operations in the world today.

Features include:

* Team and Individual permission levels
* Enabling and restricting access for third parties
* Audit logs, two factor authentication
* SSL, HTTPS, and SSH data transmission and two-factor authentication are core elements of security at GitHub

### Access to Content Delivery Networks( CDN )

Running on GitHub servers enables access by third-parties such as MaxCLI to deliver apps around the world in an inexpensive and timely fashion 

Benefits of using a CDN include:

* Instant Purge and Provisioning
	* Make your new origin deployments seen immediately.
* Real-time Reporting
	* reporting and analytics engine gives meaning to your data so you can make informed decisions.
* You can access your logs real-time through our API, our log viewer in the Control Panel or via MaxCLI—our command line interface.
* Our real-time reporting system allows you to view, calculate and predict future behavior.


## Pricing

Let's keep it simple. 

US $20K / SKU.

No charge for free open source projects - expect production just as and when time is available.

All of the above open to discussion.

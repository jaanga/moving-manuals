_{ Eventually the [Moving Manuals logo]( http://jaanga.github.io/moving-manuals/mm-logo/mm-logo-render-r1.html ) will be finished and appear here ;-}_

## _disrupting the process of assembling things_

Here are common patterns or issues that occur when you assemble furniture:

* You put something together, find a mistake and so you have to start all over again
* You look at a picture a hundred times and still do not understand
* You put something together and want to share your pleasure with others

Moving Manuals makes apps to help you put things together easier, faster and with more fun.

The apps from Moving Manuals are:

* Always available: Interactive apps that work on your phone, tablet or computer
* Easy to follow: Designed to show the process from start to finish in 3D
* A pleasure to work with: Cinematography, musical score and sets are produced for enjoyment

All of the following demos are based on popular items from the wonderful Ikea web site.
Please note that we have no connection with Ikea.
You may also see further examples this effort for [WikiHouse]( http://wikihouse.github.io/viewer-experiments/ ) and [OpenDesk]( http://opendesk.github.io/design-playground/ ).

Now please scroll down and play with our apps.
You can zoom, pan and rotate inside each demo.
Or click the 'full screen' links for a more immersive experience.

<iframe src='kallax-nxn/index.html' ></iframe>
# full screen demo: [notKallax NxN]( kallax-nxn/index.html )

You may run the four apps here or - even better - click the title under the app to run it full screen.

Each of the apps supports the following:

* Rotate = one finger / left mouse
* Zoom = two fingers / scroll wheel << full screen only
* Pan = three fingers / right mouse
* Reset = click the on the title

### Things you can do

* Create a bookshelf with seven columns width and six rows high
* Create a bookshelf with exactly just one cubbyhole
* Have a look at any of the several materials


<iframe src='kallax-wall-bracket/index.html' ></iframe>

# full screen demo: [Wall Bracket zoom-in]( kallax-wall-bracket/index.html )

One of the assembly detail. Rendered with raw colors. Four short videos rather than a long single video.
Click the buttons to watch the action.

### Things you can do

* Use your fingers or mouse to look from under the shelf
* Switch back and forth between whole shelf assemble and detail assembly
* Return to the main assembly script then come back to here

<iframe src='poang-rocking/index.html' ></iframe>

# full screen demo: [Poang Rocking Chair]( poang-rocking/index.html )

What is this pile of things on the floor? Click om 'Toggle Assembly' and watch the magic happen!

Where does each screw go? And how can I tell if I am using the correct one?
Click 'Toggle Hardware' to turn the tiny hardware pieces into giants!


### Things you can do

* Click on individual items to see them come and go from floor to final position




<iframe src='screw-and-round-nut/index.html' ></iframe>
# full screen demo: [Screw and Nut zoom-in]( screw-and-round-nut/index.html )

Again an assembly detail - rendered in 'raw' colors.

### Things you can do

* Pause the assembly video by clicking the 'Play Step-by-Step Assembly' checkbox

<!--
>> I would like it packaged in an animated power point or video that explains / illustrates:

>> b. Explaining the process / scope of doing this on the full IKEA catalogue.
>> d. A proposal on how we can work with IKEA to roll this out.

How about a web page with the apps embedded? Like what you are seeing now?

# Wait, Wait, There's More!

_This section describes the nature of a typical manual._

## Features

* View the entire process from start to finish in 3D
* Apps load very quickly
	* Much faster and easier than PDF files
* Apps run online and offline


## Benefits

* Always access to latest revisions
* Faster updates


## Try Before You Buy

The manuals are now apps - or at least working app prototypes.
And just like any app in the App store, the fastest easiest way to see if you like an app is to try it out yourself.

## Buy What You Like

If we make the difficult easy then more people can do it and some people can start tackling the really difficult

# Project Scope

_This and the following sections describe the scope and process of creating and publishing Moving Manuals._

## The Manuals

_RichardO asked if we could define the scope and process of the project. Of course we can!
Currently we are following these guile lines [Managing the Project Scope]( http://www.free-management-ebooks.com/dldebk/dlpm-scope.htm )._

_Other Sources of inspiration include A Pattern Language and this web page._


## Design and Quality Standards

We seek work with organizations that set high standards for quality and even more for improving the quality of the standards themselves.

The ease of understanding, the consistency between products, the elegance of the graphics has to match that of the exiting paper/PDF manuals.

This entails establishing a good collaborative ongoing relationship with existing technical documentation personnel/

## Knowledge / Intellectual Property

The interplay between copyright, licensing, digital rights management and intellectual property are intertwined and complex.
We seek to respect and honor all such rights and privileges.

At the same time, we take pleasure in sharing our knowledge.
We can teach and build tutorials so client designers how to make their own moving manuals.

In preparing manuals, we import 3D data directly from CD programs.
And/or we can export our data in STL, DXF, JSON and other formats.

Ownership of intellectual property remains with Moving Manuals authors unless otherwise agreed.
Licensing is up to you.

Link:

* [MIT Licence]( http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT ).
* [GNU General Public License, version 3]( http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html )

You choose. Other licenses upon agreement.




## Technical Standards

Industrial designers are not usually good at programming.

Programmers are usually not good at industrial design

The Moving Manuals require both skills and - for greatest productivity  seeks people that can combine both skill sets.

The code must be simple so that people who are mostly designers understand it.

The design tools and methods need to be standardized so that people who are mostly programmers may build and edit the designs



## FOSS

The Moving Manuals project is built using free an open source software( [FOSS]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software ) ).

The project seeks to create FOSS content and tools. It does recognize that many projects simply cannot be FOSS and succeed.

Given projects of sufficient complexity and motivation, anything can happen. ;-)

# Project Processes

_Putting together a Moving Manuals project requires consideration and development of a number of processes.
Here we begin to highlight some of the processes of immediate concern,_


## Communicate Existence of Moving Manuals to Customers/Users

A simple, fast easy way to inform people of the Moving Manuals is to place a link under the links to the PDF files in an online catalog

In the paper catalog, there could be a QR code or a short link

Add links to Catalog page and Mobile catalog page, QR code and short links,

![Catalog page]( ./kallax-nxn/kallax-catalog-page.jpg =800x800 )

<p> </p>

And on mobile, note extra link at bottom of page:


![Catalog page]( ./kallax-nxn/kallax-catalog-page-mobile.jpg =300x500 )

Adding links to existing web pages is easy



## Software Development

The Moving Manuals project is built using [Three.js]( http://threejs.org ).
Three.js is a software library written in JavaScript that makes it easy to build WebGL scripts.
WebGL is a library that enable JavaScript to communicate with the graphics processing unit (GPU ) built into every phone, tablet or computer
WebGL enables apps in the browser to run much faster than apps that cannot use the GPU.

Moving Manuals app are designed to be:

*Extremely fast-loading
	* Instead of loading large 3D databases objects are created on the fly
* Easy and fast to create, edit and maintain
	* Emphasis on multiple small scripts rather than few large scripts
	* Most under 500 lines of code
* Few dependencies
	* Apart from Three.js and its components, no other libraries are used
	* Means less to learn
* Code is seriously easy
	* Designed to be read by designers not programmers

* JavaScript is built into every web browser. It's easy to learn and if a designer knows any computer language, it's prboably JavaScript
* WebGL was introduced in 2010 and is built into recent versions of every major browser
* Three.js is one of the most popular libraries on GitHub


## Designs and Code Hosted on GitHub

![GitHub Traffic]( ./images/github-taffic-2016-03-14.jpg =800x500 )
_First day on new site. Not much traffic yet. ;-)_

All Moving Manuals designs and code are created, edited and hosted in the cloud on [GitHub]( http://github/com ).

GitHub is the largest code host on the planet with over 31 million repositories.
Large or small, every repository comes with the same powerful tools.
These tools are open to the community for public projects and secure for private projects.
There are many features and benefits to the use of GitHub as a digital repository for 3D designs.
These are features simply not available via the traditional design firm and normal designer/client collaboration.

The following sections cover the advantages of being on GitHub - and enabling small teams and big teams to collaborate without skipping a beat.


### Git Revision Control

* Frictionless Context Switching.
	* Create a branch to try out an idea, commit a few times, switch back to where you branched from, apply a patch, switch back to where you are experimenting, and merge it in.
* Role-Based Design Streams.
	* Have a design branch that always contains only what goes to production, another that you merge work into for testing, and several smaller ones for day to day work.
* Feature Based Workflow.
	* Create new design branches for each new feature you're working on so you can seamlessly switch back and forth between them, then delete each branch when that feature gets merged into your main line.
* Disposable Experimentation.
	* Create a branch to experiment in, realize it's not going to work, and just delete it - abandoning the work—with nobody else ever seeing it (even if you've pushed other branches in the meantime).

Link: [About Git]( https://git-scm.com/about )


### Collaborative Design Reviews

* Design and code reviews are an essential part of the Moving Manuals workflow
* GitHub allows you and your teammates to have a detailed discussion about every commit that is pushed to your project
	* Should it be included? Was it done correctly? Should something else be added?
	* Talk about changes to your designs with everyone involved before releasing or incorporating them.
* You can have conversations on entire commits as well as individual lines of code.
* Forking and merging designs
* Notification emails
* Graphs and contributions

Integrations with Trello, Slack, Freshdesk and many other apps and services that help you chat, track your progress, and work better with your team.

Link: [GitHub Integrations]( https://github.com/integrations )

### Issue Management and feedback / Integrated issue tracking

* Project issues page can be as simple or as sophisticated as you like
* Set a due date, name your milestone, then start grouping issues together
* Filter by open and closed issues, assignees, labels, and milestones
* Sort by issue age, number of comments, and update time


### Serious Security

Using GitHub allows a small organization to piggyback on the expertise one one of the most secure operations in the world today.

Features include:

* Team and individual permission levels
* Enabling and restricting access for third parties
* Audit logs, two factor authentication
* SSL, HTTPS, and SSH data transmission and two-factor authentication are core elements of security at GitHub

Link: [GitHub Security]( https://help.github.com/articles/github-security/ )


### Access to Content Delivery Networks( CDN )

Running on GitHub servers enables access by third-parties such as [MaxCDN]( https://maxcdn.com/ ) to deliver apps around the world in an inexpensive and timely fashion

Benefits of using a CDN include:

* Instant purging and provisioning
	* Make new origin deployments seen immediately
* Real-time reporting
	* Reporting and analytics engine gives meaning to data to help make informed decisions
	* Access logs in real-time through an API through a control panel or command line interface
	* Enables viewing, calculating and predicting future behavior


## Road Map

This document just begins to cover the possibilities. Further revisions should more detail about the following:

* Personalization
* Returning to where you were on multiple devices
* Sharing
* Marketing and Sales input
* Sounds and scoring
* Renderers and shaders
* Cinematography
* User Experience
* Disabled support
* Text to voice
* Internationalization

It's also worth noting that the entire production is built in 3D.
Therefore creating versions for virtual reality systems such as Oculus Rift or Google Cardboard
is just about as easy as flipping a few switches.


## Prospective Production Team Members <a href=#team ></a>

If this project gets to a higher level, these people will be asked to lead the production team:

* Richard Öhman ~ Founding Partner ~ CEO [point65.com]( https://www.point65.com/ )
* Theo Armour ~ Coder/Designer ~ Program Manager for three releases of AutoCAD
* Terry Green ~ User Experience ~ [twenty2product]( twenty2.com )
* Rob Shulzberg ~ Sound Design ~ Former drummer for the band _Placebo_
* Dylan Chapgier ~ Director of Photography ~ [IMDB credits]( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2368109/ )
* Jaume Sanchez ~ 3D Effects ~ [clicktorelease.com]( https://www.clicktorelease.com/ )
* Mia Harlock ~ Copywriter ~ Lead copywriter for Levi Strauss

The mission of the team would be to take the level of quality up to the standard of a high end video game

## Pricing

Let's keep it simple.

US $20K / SKU

No charge for free open source projects - just expect production as and when time is available.

All of the above - open to discussion.

## Ideas Generated by Looking at Ikea Assembly Instructions

Manuals should be understandable by people who cannot read and write.

Everything and anything in the paper manual must be included in the digital manual.

All parts that have ID numbers shall their ID numbers displayed wherever they are shown

Text warnings are displayed first. Visual advice comes next

Parts are listed and numbered

Assembly instructions

Proper positioning is pointed out

Zoom window balloons show detailed assembly

Curved arrows indicate rotation

Straight arrows indicate movement

Double-headed arrows indicate back and forth movement

Dotted lines link parts with the holes they are linked to

Parts with dotted outlines indicate customer supplied parts

Arrow Outlines indicate jumping to another portion of the manual

An 'X' indicates a warning or something that should not be done 

## Ideas Generated as We Code

When you prepare to assemble things you tend to group similar components in random piles and stacks
It is easy with computers to group similar items in perfectly arranged pies and stacks.
It is equally easy to group items like humans do.
So do it the human way.

Is it better to have several 10 to 20 second clips than to have a single one minute clip?
Perhaps getting you to push the buttons to continue make things feel mpre interactive...

Every object records it possible locations ( position + rotation )
Every clip decides which objects to use
Every frame decides the tween time and which location and which easing to use for each object

Move the camera then move the object is better than the reverse
